### Features

- You can drag and drop image files on the dedicated area
- You can see a hover effect while doing so
- Only image files are allowed
- A loader shows up before showing the uploaded photo
- You copy the link of the photo

### What I learned
- I learnt how to create url for uploaded files using file objects. I also learnt about dragover, dragleave and drop events.

### Continued Development
- I would like to make the third page responsive like others but I haven't been able to do it yet. 
- I am thinking of using PostCSS to make the code compatible with all browsers.
